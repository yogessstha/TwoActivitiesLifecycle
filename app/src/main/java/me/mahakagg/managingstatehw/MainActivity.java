/*
* Answers to questions from section 2.2
*
* Q1 - When you rotate the device (before you implement onSaveInstanceState()), the counter is reset to 0 but the contents of the edit text is preserved. Why?
* A1 - system destroys the activity when configuration change occurs. The onCreate, onStart and onResume methods are called all over again.
*
* Q2 -What Activity lifecycle methods are called when a device-configuration change (such as rotation) occurs?
 * A2 - When config change occurs the Android OS shuts down the activity (calling onPause(), onStop() and onDestroy()) and starts the activity all over again (onCreate(), onStart() and onResume())
*
* Q3 - When in the Activity lifecycle is onSaveInstanceState() called?
* A3 - This method is called before onStop()
*
* Q4 - Which is the correct method signature for onSaveInstanceState()?
* A4 - void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState) and void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState, PersistableBundle outPersistentState)
*
* Q5 - What is the difference between restoring your activity state in onCreate() versus in onRestoreInstanceState()?
* A5 - onRestoreInstanceState() can be used over onCreate() just for convenience after all the initialization or to allow subclasses to decide whether to use your default implementation (answer from Stackoverflow post : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36408776/using-oncreate-vs-onrestoreinstancestate)
*
* Q6 - If you quit and restart your app, what happens to the Activity state?
* A6 - Activity gets destroyed when quitting and is created again when restarted.
